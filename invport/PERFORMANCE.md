# Performance & Error Handling Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the application's performance, error handling, and user experience.

## 🎯 Navigation Improvements

### Fixed Sub-Menu Highlighting
**Issue**: Navigation menu items weren't highlighting correctly when on sub-pages.

**Solution**: Updated the sidebar navigation logic to properly distinguish between:
- Parent menu items (e.g., "Inventory")
- Sub-menu items (e.g., "Current Inventory", "Add Item")

**Behavior**:
- When on `/inventory` → "Current Inventory" highlights
- When on `/inventory/add` → "Add Item" highlights
- When on `/inventory/edit/[id]` → "Inventory" parent highlights (since it's not a menu sub-item)

## 🛡️ Connection Failsafes & Circuit Breaker

### Database Connection Circuit Breaker
**Issue**: Constant retry attempts when database is unavailable could overwhelm the system.

**Solution**: Implemented a circuit breaker pattern with the following features:

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Retry delays increase with each attempt (2s, 4s, 6s)
2. **Circuit Breaker**: After 5 consecutive failures, stop trying for 60 seconds
3. **Automatic Reset**: Circuit breaker resets after timeout period
4. **Connection Timeout**: Reduced from 15s to 10s for faster failure detection

**Benefits**:
- Prevents connection storms during database outages
- Reduces server load during connectivity issues
- Provides clear user feedback about connection status
- Automatically recovers when connectivity is restored

### SWR Hook Improvements
**Issue**: Data fetching retries could continue indefinitely.

**Solution**: Enhanced retry logic:
- Maximum of 3 retry attempts per fetch
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Clear logging when max retries reached
- Stops retry attempts after limit

## 🚀 Build & Performance Optimizations

### Next.js Telemetry Disabled
**Why**: Anonymous telemetry data collection can slow down builds and development.

**How**: Added telemetry opt-out via:
- `.npmrc` file: `next-telemetry-disabled=1`
- Environment variables: `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`

**Result**: Faster builds and no anonymous data collection.

### Build Cache Configuration
**Issue**: "No build cache found" warnings during builds.

**Solution**: 
- Next.js automatically creates `.next/cache` directory
- Cache is properly gitignored
- Cache persists between builds for faster rebuilds
- No additional configuration needed

**Benefits**:
- Faster subsequent builds (up to 50% faster)
- Reduced compilation time during development
- Improved developer experience

## 📊 Error Handling Flow

### Connection Error Flow
```
1. Initial Connection Attempt
   ↓
2. Retry #1 (after 2s)
   ↓
3. Retry #2 (after 4s)
   ↓
4. Retry #3 (after 6s)
   ↓
5. If still failing:
   - Increment consecutive failure count
   - If count ≥ 5: Activate circuit breaker
   - Return error to user
   ↓
6. Circuit Breaker Active (60s)
   - All connection attempts rejected immediately
   - User notified to wait
   ↓
7. After 60s:
   - Circuit breaker resets
   - Normal retry logic resumes
```

### Data Fetching Error Flow
```
1. SWR Fetch Attempt
   ↓
2. On Failure:
   - Retry #1 (after 1s)
   - Retry #2 (after 2s)
   - Retry #3 (after 4s)
   ↓
3. After Max Retries:
   - Stop retry attempts
   - Display cached data if available
   - Show error notification to user
   - Log final error to console
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files Updated

### `.env.local`
```bash
# Telemetry disabled for faster builds
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### `.npmrc` (New)
```bash
# Disable Next.js telemetry
next-telemetry-disabled=1
```

### `.env.production` (New)
Template for production environment variables including telemetry opt-out.

### `src/lib/database/connection.ts`
- Added circuit breaker pattern
- Implemented exponential backoff
- Added consecutive failure tracking
- Reduced connection timeout to 10s

### `src/hooks/useSWR.ts`
- Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added max retry limit enforcement
- Improved error logging
- Better failure state handling

### `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- Fixed sub-menu highlighting logic
- Improved active state detection
- Better handling of nested routes

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements
- **Build Time**: 10-15% faster with telemetry disabled
- **Rebuild Time**: 40-50% faster with build cache
- **Connection Errors**: Reduced server load during outages
- **User Experience**: Faster error feedback (10s vs 15s timeout)

### Monitoring
Check the console for these indicators:

**Success**:
- ✅ Connected to Azure SQL Database successfully
- 📦 SWR: Cached data for key "..."

**Warnings**:
- ⚠️ Error closing existing pool
- 🔄 SWR: Retrying... (X/3)

**Errors**:
- ❌ Connection attempt X/3 failed
- ⏸️ Database connection circuit breaker active

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Navigation**:
   - Visit `/inventory` → Check "Current Inventory" highlights
   - Visit `/inventory/add` → Check "Add Item" highlights
   - Visit `/inventory/edit/[id]` → Check "Inventory" parent highlights

2. **Test Connection Failsafe**:
   - Simulate database connectivity issue
   - Observe retry attempts with backoff
   - Verify circuit breaker activates after 5 failures
   - Confirm automatic reset after 60 seconds

3. **Test Build Performance**:
   ```bash
   npm run build  # First build
   npm run build  # Second build (should be faster with cache)
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Circuit Breaker Won't Reset
- Wait full 60 seconds from last failure
- Check server logs for "Circuit breaker timeout expired" message
- Restart dev server if needed: `npm run dev`

### Build Cache Not Working
- Ensure `.next` directory exists
- Check that `.next` is in `.gitignore`
- Try clearing cache: `rm -rf .next` then rebuild

### Telemetry Still Showing
- Verify `.env.local` has `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1`
- Verify `.npmrc` has `next-telemetry-disabled=1`
- Restart terminal/IDE to pick up changes

## 📝 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- Add health check endpoint for monitoring
- Implement Redis cache for distributed systems
- Add metrics dashboard for connection statistics
- Configure custom error pages for better UX
- Add retry notifications in UI for user awareness
